					<p>Easts have been involved in PVL since 2004 when we started with just one team.</p>
					<p>We are continuing to strive for good representation across the PVL competition divisions. This year, we are aiming for a Grand Prix team in addition to PVL. So this may see some changes to the teams that we enter into PVL.</p>
					<h3>Key Dates</h3>
					<p>Volleyball Queensland will finalise the dates shortly and they will be advertised here.  The season generally runs for 16 rounds starting in early April and concluding in late August.</p>
					<p>Easts trials for PVL are held mid February and further information of costs and details of training sessions will be added as soon as they become available.</p>

					<p>Easts run open social training sessions to allow the beginner adult players to improve their skill level.  These players often may not be able to commit to a full season of competitive volleyball and wish to have the flexibility to shorter seasons or a lower level of competition. Players can attend training on a weekly basis but the schedule is flexible to fit into the persons schedules, hence there is no fixed commitment to attend every week.
