					<p>The Junior Development Squad is run for those players from 9 – 15 years of age. Split into two section based on age and skills level.  </p>
					<p>The junior group (ages 9 – 12 years) work on a modified program with smaller courts and lower net heights.  The drills focus on the raw motor skills of moving and eye-hand coordination to play the base skills of the game of volleyball.</p>
					<p>The older group (ages 13-15 years) work at developing and mastering their technique and base skills to reach their full potential, and at the same time learn the importance of teamwork. Skills they can take back to their school, regional and state teams.</p>
					<p>Players from this squad have the opportunity to trial and represent Easts in both of Brisbane’s major Volleyball Leagues with many going on to represent their Brisbane regional teams and State teams.</p>
					<p>These young players will be coached by our team of highly experienced coaches, some of them with more than 20 years of coaching.</p>

					<h3>competition (as proposed from 2019)</h3>
					<p>The competition runs for six rounds plus two weeks of finals.  The season runs from mid-May to early August. The weeks are not consecutive weeks and are chosen to avoid school holidays and major school tournaments that happen during this time.  Therefore, on the day of each round the teams play two games and have a duty.</p>
